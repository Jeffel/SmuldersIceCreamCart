# SmuldersIceCreamCart
A project for Principles of Data Management Fall 2017 revolving around an Ice Cream delivery service.

The project is inspired by a fire Dragonborn named Smulder from our D&D campaign who has a dream of running an ice cream cart business.

"Your ice cream in 10 minutes or less... or free soup!" - Smulder, Entrepeneur and CEO
